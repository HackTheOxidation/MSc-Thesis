\chapter{Conclusion}

To summarise, in this MSc Thesis project we have gone through the phases of defining requirements, architecting, designing, implementing
and testing a new compiler for the Hygge programming language called \texttt{JHygge}, which is written in the \texttt{Java} programming
language (JDK 24) and generates bytecode for the JVM as its target. Analysing the existing reference compiler, \texttt{hyggec}, written in
\texttt{F\#}, generating RISC-V assembly, also revealed opportunities for improvement with regards to the extensibility and flexibility
of the design.
