\chapter{Compiler Architecture and Design}

In this chapter, we want to go on a journey and explore existing compiler designs and architectures both in general and
for specific programming languages. These languages of choice are Scala, Kotlin, Groovy and Clojure, which all primarily target the JVM platform,
yet are very different.

At the end of this journey, after having summarize our findings and attempt to utilize this newly-gained experience to come up with a suitable
architecture and design for the new Hygge compiler that aims to fulfill all the constraints imposed by the requirements stated in the previous chapter.
